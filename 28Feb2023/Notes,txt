Promises:

Whenever we make an async api call, we need to handle the response 
provided by the server. 

The possibilities of a response can be success or failure. 

The backend applications provides the response that can contain success data or 
failure data. 

The promises handles the response wisely using resolve (success) and reject(failure) functions. 

We use axios to make API calls in react.
